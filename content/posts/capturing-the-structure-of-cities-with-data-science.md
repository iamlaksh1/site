During the Spatial Data Science Conference 2021, I had a chance to deliver a workshop illustrating the application of PySAL and momepy in understanding the structure of cities. The recording is now available for everyone. The materials are available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/martinfleis/sdsc21-workshop) and you can even run the whole notebook in your browser using the MyBinder service.
