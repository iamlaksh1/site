I'm a Senior Geospatial Software Engineer specializing in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). My passion drives me toward location technologies, spatial data, and cloud computing. Through the years, I've built cloud-native solutions using Python, JavaScript, and AWS, while also developing proficiency with Azure and Kubernetes environments.

My career has largely focused on the Oil and Gas industry, where I've led teams developing enterprise geospatial platforms and cloud solutions for various clients. I've honed my skills across multiple platforms - from Esri ArcGIS and Geoserver to Mapbox and numerous open-source GIS tools. I've also accumulated significant experience with IQGeo product development and customization.

Today, I apply this diverse technical background in my role as a Senior Geospatial Software Engineer, where I continue to explore the intersection of spatial data, cloud architecture, and innovative problem-solving.
